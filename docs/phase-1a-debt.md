# Phase 1A Debt

Tracking explicit deferrals from the original module specs. Each entry names
the gap, why we deferred it, and where (which later module) we expect to
pick it up.

---

## Auth module (Module 1)

- **RBAC enforcement on staff endpoints**. Currently any authenticated
  staff member can access `/admin/seller-invitations` and its variants.
  Per the original spec these should be scoped to
  `SUPER_ADMIN` + `SELLER_APPROVAL_ADMIN` via a `@StaffAuth(...)` decorator
  (or equivalent). Deferred because designing the full role/action matrix
  across all 18 modules is non-trivial and the staff base currently
  consists of one super-admin in dev.
  **Pick up:** Module 12 (Admin Dashboard) or earlier if multi-role staff
  is added before that.

- **Notification template variable schema validation**. The
  `notification_templates.variables` JSON column is present and persisted
  but not yet enforced. The `EmailDispatchService` doesn't validate the
  variables passed in against any declared shape. Deferred because no
  template currently declares a `variables` schema and the first ones to
  do so will land with Phase 1B's remittance flows.
  **Pick up:** Module 11 (Notifications) when templates with strict
  variable contracts arrive, or when the first regression bites.

- **BullMQ worker living inside the API process**. Phase 1A wires the
  email worker via `OnModuleInit` inside `apps/api`. Long-term it should
  move to `apps/workers` so the API can scale horizontally without
  duplicating worker capacity. Deferred to keep the auth-module commit
  unit small.
  **Pick up:** Module 11 (Notifications) when other workers — outbound
  webhooks, RTO reconciliation, etc. — make the split worthwhile.

- **Click-to-call integration**. Twilio integration for call agents is
  out of scope for Phase 1A per the original module roadmap. Call
  attempts are logged manually for now.
  **Pick up:** Phase 2.

- **Notification template versioning UX**. We persist `templateVersion`
  on `notification_logs` (so old messages can be re-rendered against
  their original template version) but there's no admin UI to manage
  versions yet.
  **Pick up:** Module 14 (System Settings UI).

## Seller onboarding & admin (Module 2)

- **Welcome-email enqueue is outside the registration transaction.**
  `SellerAuthService.registerViaInvitation()` enqueues
  `seller.welcome.email` after the registration `prisma.$transaction`
  commits (with a try/catch swallowing failures). Module 2 introduced
  the inside-tx pattern for suspension, reapproval, and onboarding-
  complete emails so enqueue failure rolls back the DB. The welcome
  enqueue should be harmonized with that pattern for consistency.
  **Pick up:** at the next touch of seller-auth, or whenever the auth
  module is otherwise refactored.

- **RBAC enforcement on `/admin/sellers/*`.** Currently any
  authenticated staff member can list sellers, suspend/reapprove,
  manage notes, and override onboarding steps. Per the original Module
  2 spec, status changes and note edits should be scoped (likely
  `SUPER_ADMIN` + `SELLER_APPROVAL_ADMIN`; CSR roles read-only). Same
  underlying gap as the seller-invitations RBAC debt above.
  **Pick up:** Module 12 (Admin Dashboard) with the wider RBAC roll-out.

- **Note authorship not enforced on edit/delete.** `PATCH` and `DELETE`
  on `/admin/sellers/:id/notes/:noteId` accept any staff member, not
  just the original author. The Module 2 spec explicitly called this
  out as covered by the broader RBAC tightening.
  **Pick up:** alongside the RBAC roll-out above.

- **Onboarding-complete fire-once relies on `notification_logs`.** The
  fire-once check looks for a `notification_log` row with
  `templateCode = "seller.onboarding_complete.email"` and `recipientId
  = sellerId`. If the email worker fails to write the log row (e.g.,
  DB unavailable) but the email actually went out, a future re-trigger
  could double-send. Practical risk is low — the worker writes the log
  row in the same operation as the send — but a notification-level
  dedup key would make this airtight.
  **Pick up:** Module 11 (Notifications), when worker idempotency keys
  land.

## Catalog & Inventory (Modules 4–5)

- _No entries yet._ Update as work lands.

---

## Pricing & Multi-Currency (Modules 15–17)

- **Historical FX rate tracking**. Phase 1A keeps a single current rate
  per currency pair; historical conversions use the as-of-then rate
  recorded on the order. Full historical FX rate timeseries deferred to
  Phase 1B.
  **Pick up:** Phase 1B with the remittance/wallet work.
